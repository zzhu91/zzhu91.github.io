I'm a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at University of Maryland, College Park. My research focuses on data-driven security which applied machine learning to solve various security problems. For example, I designed a system to suggest informative features for Android malware detection from unstructured natural-language data ([FeatureSmith](http://featuresmith.org)); I extracted kill chains from security blogs to explain real-world measurements ([ChainSmith](http://ioc-chainsmith.org)).
